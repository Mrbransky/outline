This is a lot of technical stuff, BUT
  You’re going to do well.

Being right is not important (impossible?), BUT
  think hard, be thoughtful, and try.


There are many many tools to make things easier for all of us. I'll try not to use them, because they all go extinct.

--- for me only ---

use terms early that won’t be relevant until later, like “Event Listener”, browser, console, bug, Camel Case, ==, ||, &&

I will do a lot of showing and as it might be the first time you've seen any of it, much of it will be over you head. Just watch and pay attention. This is about familiarization, not note taking or recording. Watching me do something over and over will hopefully get you prepared when it comes time for the readings and exercises, where you can take the notes and go at your preferred pace. I don't want your jaw to hit the floor when we start javascript in 8 weeks. At the very least, we need to be familiar with what the stuff looks like

Assignments:

I hope everything we do has some opportunity to be creative. In the early part of the class, I apologize, there has to be some level of "this is boring...", but later on I implore you to find ways to make something worth it. Moreover, if you ever feel like something seems really useless, lets make sure we talk about it, because maybe I overlooked something, or neglected to mention *why* it is worth it to me.

Assignments are going to be 75 points expected. 100 points will be on the table, so you can skip parts if you want. I'm going to try and make the fun stuff more difficult, and the easy stuff kinda boring, so you can get to the 75 (and above) any way you want.
