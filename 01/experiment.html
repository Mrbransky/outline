      <h2>Your own markup language.</h2>
      <p>Rationale: People spend time on silly things, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">this programming laguage</a>. Sometimes, syntax can uncomplicate very complicated datasets such as this <a href="../01/markup.jpg">music website CMS</a> I made a few years ago.</p>
