### Credo
Being right is not important (impossible?), BUT
  think hard, be thoughtful, and try.

### Explanation of terms
use terms early that won’t be relevant until later, like “Event Listener”, browser, console, bug, Camel Case, ==, ||, &&

### Keeping up:
I will do a lot of showing and as it might be the first time you've seen any of it, much of it will be over you head. Just watch and pay attention. This is about familiarization, not note taking or recording. Watching me do something over and over will hopefully get you prepared when it comes time for the readings and exercises, where you can take the notes and go at your preferred pace. I don't want your jaw to hit the floor when we start javascript in 8 weeks. At the very least, we need to be familiar with what the stuff looks like. This is a low pressure opportunity to watch someone **DO** – and it will take many watches for it to sink in, no way around it.

Don't make a habit of not paying attention and not asking for clarification. As we get further into the semester, my patience for talking about stuff we covered weeks ago will wane in perfect balance.

### Assignments:
I hope everything we do has some opportunity to be creative. In the early part of the class, I apologize, there has to be some level of "this is boring...", but later on I implore you to find ways to make something worth it. Moreover, if you ever feel like something seems really useless, lets make sure we talk about it, because maybe I overlooked something, or neglected to mention *why* it is worth it to me.

Assignments are going to be 75 points expected. 100 points will be on the table, so you can skip parts if you want. I'm going to try and make the fun stuff more difficult, and the easy stuff kinda boring, so you can get to the 75 (and above) any way you want.

The basic breakdown will be something to read for 0 points, some sort of exercize designed to be give a terse overview of material, something that gives you an opportunity to be creative, something that will be take it or leave it and worth very little but will build on itself every week (so skipping could be a pain) and lastly, a challenge, designed to be easy or hard, depending on how you want to go about it.
